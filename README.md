This project uses a rapsberry pi and a pi camera to create a photoframe that is activated by movement and gets its photos from google photos
it is largely based on https://github.com/sitina/piframe only i have remvoed some of the stuff that is displayed
i also used the motion detection code from https://towardsdatascience.com/image-analysis-for-beginners-creating-a-motion-detector-with-opencv-4ca6faba4b42 jsut had to modify it a bit to use the picamera and turn it into a counter rather then a display
